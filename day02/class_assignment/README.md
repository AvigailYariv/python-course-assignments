This GUI program in calculating the user's specific age. The input the user should input is his day of birth and the output is your age in years and months. 

There are three different python files which each responsable for something else. One is for the GUI of the calculator, one is for the calculations of the age, and the last is for the main function to run.

Doing this small program I have used the Copilot of VScode. The messege I wrote him was:
I want to change the program that I copied from my teacher to somthing else. I want that the GUI will be in light pink. In addition I want you to change the files and the functions so it will not calculate triangle area but it will calculate user's age according to the input - birthday date.
for exaple: my birthday is 24th in February 1999 so the input should be 24/02/1999 and the output will be the years and months of my age (for the example my output should be 26 years and 8 months)
