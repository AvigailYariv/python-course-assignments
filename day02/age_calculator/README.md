## 📋 Description

The program asks the user to enter their birth date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY` using the command line.  
It then calculates the difference between the current date and the user's birth date and displays their exact age in years, months, and days.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to type their date of birth (e.g. `24/02/1999`).
2. It reads the input from the command line using the built-in `input()` function.
3. It uses Python's `datetime` module to calculate the exact time difference between today and the entered birth date.
4. Finally, it prints the result in a readable format such as: '26 years, 8 months and 15 days.'
