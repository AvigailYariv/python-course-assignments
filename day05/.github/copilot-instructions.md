# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Battleship game.  

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This File
This file guides GitHub Copilot so that its code suggestions:
- stay consistent with the structure of the project  
- follow clean coding practices  
- do NOT override the original logic of the Battleship game unless explicitly requested  
- avoid generating interactive I/O unless needed  
- help primarily with **tests**, documentation, and small improvements

---

## ✔️ When Copilot *Should* Help
Copilot is allowed and encouraged to assist with:

- Writing **unit tests** or automated test scripts  
- Improving documentation (README, comments, docstrings)  
- Generating helper functions only when requested  
- Refactoring code while keeping the original functionality  
- Creating example usage  
- Generating non-game files such as CI configs, markdown, or boilerplate code  

---

## ❌ When Copilot Should *Not* Help
Copilot should NOT:

- Rewrite the entire game logic without being explicitly asked  
- Remove or break existing functionality  
- Change the rules or behavior of the game  
- Add external dependencies unless specifically requested  
- Generate interactive UI or GUI code unless asked
