This GUI program in calculating the user's specific age. The input the user should input is his day of birth and the output is your age in years and months. 

There are three different python files which each responsable for something else. One is for the GUI of the calculator, one is for the calculations of the age, and the last is for the main function to run.

Doing this small program I have used the Copilot of VScode.
